TMP36 is a very cheap and accurate temperature sensor. The TMP36 temperature sensor is an easy way to measure temperature using an Arduino. To get the temperature we just need to measure the output voltage and a little bit of math! A temperature sensor is exactly what it sounds like a sensor used to measure ambient temperature. This particular sensor has three pins a positive, a ground, and a signal. This is a linear temperature sensor. A change in temperature of one degree centigrade is equal to a change of 10 millivolts at the sensor output. Here we measures the temperature by using TMP36 temperature sensor with the help of arduino. The project is a temperature sensor made with an Arduino UNO and TMP36 sensor and a few other components. The main aim of the project is to detect the temperature of the surroundings and display it on the LCD. The working of the project starts with the TMP36 sensor that senses the change in temperature of the surrounding, and uses that temperature difference to produce a voltage signal which is processed by the Arduino to give a digital output displaying the temperature of the given surrounding.
