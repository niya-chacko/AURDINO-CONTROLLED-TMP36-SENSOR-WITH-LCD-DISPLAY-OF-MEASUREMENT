	The TMP36 temperature sensor is an easy way to measure temperature using an Arduino. The sensor can measure a fairly wide range of temperature (-50°C to 125°C), is fairly precise (0.1°C resolution), and is very low cost, making it a popular choice. In this tutorial we will go over the basics of hooking the TMP36 up and writing some basic code to read the analog input it is connected to. This sensor is not weatherproof, so it will need to be shielded from direct exposure to the elements.
 Unlike a thermistor, the TMP36 does not have a temperature sensitive resistor. Instead this sensor uses the property of diodes; as a diode changes temperature the voltage changes with it at a known rate. The sensor measures the small change and outputs an analog voltage between 0 and 1.75VDC based on it. To get the temperature we just need to measure the output voltage and a little bit of math.
